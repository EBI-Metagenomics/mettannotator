## Introduction

**ebi-metagenomics/mettannotator** is a bioinformatics pipeline that ...

WIP

## Usage

First, prepare a assemblies_sheet with your input data that looks as follows:

`assemblies_sheet.csv`:

```csv
prefix,assembly
BU_ATCC8492VPI0062_NT5002,BU_ATCC8492VPI0062_NT5002.fa

```

Now, you can run the pipeline using:

```bash
nextflow run ebi-metagenomics/mettannotator \
   -profile <docker/singularity/...> \
   --input samplesheet.csv \
   --outdir <OUTDIR>
```

> **Warning:**
> Please provide pipeline parameters via the CLI or Nextflow `-params-file` option. Custom config files including those
> provided by the `-c` Nextflow option can be used to provide any configuration _**except for parameters**_;
> see [docs](https://nf-co.re/usage/configuration#custom-configuration-files).
